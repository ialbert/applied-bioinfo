# Bioinformatics Course

A repository that demonstrates how to use git to create reusable data analysis workflows.

## How to use `git`

The main commands you will need to know are:

- `git clone url` - clone a repository from a remote server. This needs to be done only once.

- `git add path_to_the_file` - add a file to the git tracking. This needs to be done for each file that you wish to track.

- `git status` - check the status of the repository. This will show you which files are being tracked, which files are not being tracked, and which files have changes that have not been committed.

- `git commit -am "message"` - commit changes to the repository. The `-a` flag means that all changes will be committed, and the `-m` flag means that the commit message will be the one provided.

- `git push` - push changes to the remote server
